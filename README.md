# TwitterBot_HFT
A Twitter bot that uses the Alpaca API &amp; Twitter streaming API to tigger trades
BTW this shit does not work yet lol, I'm able to pull the tweets addressed to the bot but I still need to develop the logic for the bot
to break down the string (i.e., the tweet) and communicate that extrapolated info onto the Alpaca bot that triggers the trade (either to buy/sell).
Any advice regarding making this simpler would be greatly appreciated.
